# Atom Tab Manager

Get smarter tabs with options for automatic tab management.  This Atom plug-in
makes tabs more useful for developers by automatically sorting tabs so
that you can easily find related and recently edited files.

  * Close tabs you are no longer using.
  * Sort by most recently used.
  * Keep related files next to each other.
